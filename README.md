<h1 align="center"> MediPal </h1>
MediPal is open source medical software that gives users true access to their holistic health picture. This application is meant to simplify getting the important information to the person in ways they are able to understand.

<h1 align="center"> How It's Made </h1>
Tech Used: C#, Blazor Web App (.NET), Bootstrap, SQL Express
<br></br>
The project is based on Blazor Web App with capability of both client and server side rendering. All main information is currently stored server side, allowing for direct database access without required web API calls. Information is currently stored on local databases using SQL Express. 
<br></br>
Authentication and authorization are both applied to ensure proper access to the application, both through use of general user login and assigned roles. CRUD operations are executed to update information such as symptom tracking for each user.

<h1 align="center"> Inspiration </h1>
This project is inspired by the experience of my wife and I working through her cancer diagnosis and always having communication issues / information disconnects with the medical team. We were at the regional University Hospital that had the best team, but due to an overburdened medical system and the natural friction that occurs on teams, we encountered a lot of friction in knowing what was going on. 
<br></br>
I want this project to empower patients to learn more about their circumstances, relieve their pain points in communication, as well as provide a relief to the medical team's burden to keep patient's constantly performed in an already overwhelming environment.

<h1 align="center"> Optimizations </h1>
<ul>
  <li>Client-Side rendering for specific features</li>
  <li>Authentication (2FA)</li>
  <li>Chat Functionality</li>
  <li>Cloud Storage</li>
  <li>Add Azure Open Search integration</li>
  <li>Add Open AI integration</li
</ul>
<br></br>
<h1 align="center"> Lessons Learned </h1>
This project has taught me how to implement C# fundamentals into an actual .NET application framework. I've learned about application design, dependency injection, authorization and authentication, database integration with personal and foreign keys, and many other topics.
<br></br>
More importantly, I've learned that there are technical aspects, such as the code design and implementation, and there are functional aspects, referring to how the program functions when used by an actual user. The key to building a great project is bridging these two concepts.
